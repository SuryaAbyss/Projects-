üõë Website Blocker
This Python script blocks access to specific websites by modifying the system's hosts file. It ensures the listed websites remain blocked until a specified end date and automatically restores access after the time expires.

‚ú® Features
Blocks websites by redirecting them to 127.0.0.1.
Continuously enforces restrictions until the given end date (January 15, 2025).
Automatically removes the restrictions after the blocking period ends.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The script checks if the current date is before January 15, 2025.
If the condition is met, it adds the specified websites (www.wscubetech.com, www.pw.live) to the hosts file.
Once the blocking period expires, it removes the blocked websites from the hosts file, restoring access.
The script runs in a continuous loop, checking and updating the blocking status at intervals.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Administrator/root privileges are required to modify the hosts file.
The script is designed for Windows (C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts). Modify the path for other OS.
Editing the hosts file incorrectly can impact network connectivity, so use with caution.

üöÄ How to Use
Run the script with Python (python script.py).
Ensure administrator/root privileges are granted.
The script will block the listed websites until the set date.
