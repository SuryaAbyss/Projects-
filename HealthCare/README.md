### Adding Images to Your GitHub Repository

To include the images in your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the Images**: Place the images (`Web_page-0001.jpg` and `Web_page-0002.jpg`) in the root directory of your repository or in a specific folder (e.g., `images/`).

2. **Update the README File**: Ensure the paths to the images in the README file match the actual paths in your repository. If you place the images in an `images/` folder, update the paths accordingly:

   ```markdown
   ![Dashboard View 1](images/Web_page-0001.jpg)
   ![Dashboard View 2](images/Web_page-0002.jpg)
   ```

3. **Commit and Push**: Commit the changes to your repository and push them to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git add README.md Web_page-0001.jpg Web_page-0002.jpg
   git commit -m "Add README and dashboard screenshots"
   git push origin main
   ```

This README file provides a comprehensive overview of your project, its features, and how to use it. The images will visually demonstrate the dashboard's interface, giving users a clear idea of what to expect.
