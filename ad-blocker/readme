Website Blocker
This Python script blocks access to specific websites by modifying the system's hosts file. It continuously monitors the current date and ensures that the specified websites remain blocked until a predefined end date.

‚ú® Features
Blocks access to websites by redirecting them to 127.0.0.1.
Runs in a loop to enforce restrictions until the specified end_time.
Automatically unblocks websites after the blocking period ends.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The script checks if the current date is before January 15, 2025.
If true, it adds the specified websites (www.wscubetech.com, www.pw.live) to the hosts file, redirecting them to 127.0.0.1.
After the blocking period ends, the script removes the blocked websites from the hosts file, restoring access.
The script runs continuously, checking the status at regular intervals.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
This script modifies system files (hosts file), so administrator/root privileges are required.
The hosts file path is set for Windows (C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts). Update it accordingly for other operating systems.
Be cautious when modifying the hosts file, as incorrect changes can affect internet connectivity.

üöÄ How to Use
Run the script with Python.
Ensure that it has sufficient permissions to modify the hosts file.
The specified websites will be blocked until the set date.
